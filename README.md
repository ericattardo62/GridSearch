# GridSearch

This is a small game designed using basic principles of the C language. The program generates a grid of a user selected
size and fills is with capital 'X' characters. One lowercase 'x' is randomly placed on the grid and the user is tasked with
finding it. The program prompts the user to enter the X and Y coordinates of the x on the grid and will prompt the user to try
again if entered incorrectly or be prompted with a victory message and prompted to exit or play again on a victory.
